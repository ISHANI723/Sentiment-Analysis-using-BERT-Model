# Problem statement:
With the growing volume of online text data, analyzing user sentiment has become essential. 
Traditional sentiment analysis methods often fail to capture the context and nuances of language, leading to inaccurate results. 
This project uses BERT, a powerful deep learning model, to improve sentiment classification of movie reviews. 
By fine-tuning a pretrained BERT model on a small custom dataset, we aim to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments. 
The ability to automatically classify sentiment can be useful in various applications such as customer feedback analysis and social media monitoring.

# Objectives
1.	To perform sentiment analysis using BERT: The goal is to leverage BERT's advanced natural language processing capabilities to analyze and determine the sentiment of movie reviews.
2.	To fine-tune a pretrained BERT model on a small custom dataset: Fine-tuning allows us to adapt BERT, a general-purpose model, for the specific task of sentiment analysis using a small set of labeled movie reviews.
3.	To accurately classify movie reviews as positive or negative: The project aims to build a robust model capable of distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments with high accuracy. 
4.	To evaluate the performance of the model: After training the model, we will assess its accuracy and effectiveness using testing data. This evaluation will help determine how well the model generalizes to new, unseen reviews and provide insights into areas for improvement.
